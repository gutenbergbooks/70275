<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p>In presenting to the world the
extraordinary document which follows,
the Publisher deems it fit, by way of
Preface, to advert briefly to the principal
circumstances and persons connected with
this great outrage, which it embodies,
upon the sensibilities and morals of the
public—distinctly repudiating, himself,
any endorsement of the views of the
misguided writer, and deeply regretting
the scandal which has attached in consequence
of her acts to the influential
Society of Friends, and to the numerous
high families, with which she is allied,
both in England and America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The Gurney Family is known wherever
on the Eastern or Western continent, philanthropy,
charity, liberality in its most
comprehensive meaning, scholarship and
literary ability of the highest order, or
wealth in the most profuse exuberance,
becomes the theme of the social circle or
the text of the author’s pen. It is, moreover,
one of the most notable and ancient
of the English aristocracy, dating from the
time of the Conqueror, ever since when
they have held wealth and position in the
County of Norfolk, where nearly all the
various members of the name still reside.
In England’s early and stormy days they
rendered essential service to the State in
many famous battles both at home and
abroad—for it was at a comparatively
recent date only that this till then redoubtable
race became identified, through some
of its branches, with the pacific and lowly
doctrines of the Quakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>They are closely connected with families
here of the very highest respectability
of character—the celebrated John Joseph
Gurney having taken a wife from this
city; and no man in the Society of Friends
ranked equal to him in his day, either in
religious influence, mental ability, or excellence
of heart. His indeed gave the name
to the Gurneyite Orthodox Friends, of which
branch of that sect he was the acknowledged
leader. He died about twelve years
ago.</p>

<p>His only son, John Henry Gurney,
who was the heir not merely of his father’s
wealth, and name, but of his good character,
is the betrayed husband of this
story. He is the present representative
in Parliament of King’s Lynn, Norfolkshire,
and is noted for his liberal political sentiments.
He is now forty years of age.</p>

<p>His wife, Mary Gurney, the author of
this letter, was the daughter and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
child of Richard Hanbury Gurney, a first
cousin of John Joseph, and belonging
to the elder, wealthier, and representative
branch of the race—he, Richard,
deceased only within a few years, having
been a younger half-brother, and the only
one, of the actual head of the Family—the
venerable Hudson Gurney, of Keswick,
F.R.S., F.A.S., Ex-High Sheriff of Norfolk,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Whilst Hudson Gurney it is true inherited
principally the patrimonial estates,
Richard, his half-brother, became the heir
of his own mother, who had been a Miss
Hanbury of the wealthy family of London
brewers of that name. This fortune, over
a million sterling, became at Richard’s
death the inheritance of his daughter Mary,
the author of this letter, now about twenty-eight
years of age, and the mother of two
or three children.</p>

<p>Samuel Gurney the eminent banker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and philanthropist was a brother of John
Joseph, and Mrs. Elizabeth Fry, whose
labors and sacrifices to improve the discipline
of the great prisons on both continents
have won her a name to be envied,
was his sister. Another sister was the
wife, and zealous assistant, of Sir Thomas
Fowell Buxton, celebrated in the annals
of British Emancipation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gurney is thus allied by descent
and marriage with families of the first
note both in Europe and America, and
holds in her own right an almost princely
estate. She was constantly, up to the
very period of her departure, anticipated
in her lightest wish by a husband who
knew no will but her own. With such
surroundings, elevating her to the very
highest sphere of English social life, with
all its splendors and attractions, and
securing to her the enjoyment of every
rational pleasure, after thirteen years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
married life, she voluntarily renounced her
husband, her children and family, not in
any moment of passion, but through a
calm conviction of reason, as she herself
states, and left England, the mistress of
a common groom from her stables.</p>

<p>There can be no pardon nor extenuation
for this great social crime.</p>

<p>But the motives which led to it
are well worthy of the reader’s patient
consideration. They are stated in her
letter with logical precision, and at the
same time with the apparent enthusiasm
and tenderness of a heart which had suffered
and loved intensely; and whatever the
explanation, whether deducible from an
exaggeration of facts, or an artful use of
language, her words really seem to be
stamped with the seal of social martyrdom.</p>

<p>Whilst the general tenor of the doctrines
she enunciates cannot fail to administer
a shock to every healthy mind, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
not necessary for the cause of morality,
and it would be unjust indeed, to denounce
her letter <em>in toto</em>.</p>

<p>Every authentic history of personal
experience forms a helpful addition for the
guidance and behavior of mankind.</p>

<p>The deplorable consequences of an early
and hasty marriage, as portrayed in her own
history, may serve as a useful beacon to rash
youth in all ages to come.</p>

<p>Her earnest plea on behalf of Personal
Merit cannot fail to win its way to many
hearts—at least in this Country, the foster-home
of the plebeiance and of democracy.</p>

<p>But to her concluding argument especially
are attention and respect due.</p>

<p>The investigations heretofore made in
this Country and Europe have developed a
frightful catalogue of diseases and deaths
resulting from inter-marriages; and more
recent examinations in the wards of Hospitals,
in the Asylums for Feeble-minded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Children, in Institutions for the Deaf and
Dumb, and Blind, trace directly those monstrosities
and defects of organization, in a
preponderating number of cases, to marriages
of this character. Whether her immediate
example furnished any confirmation on this
head, the meagre details of the whole affair,
which have been permitted to be divulged,
do not afford any certain information; that
it has been so in other branches of her
family, and that the dread of it was upon
her own mind, is most apparent in her letter.</p>

<p>Her authoritative and vehement invective
against these internecine marriages, it
cannot be doubted, will draw prominent
attention to the subject; and on this account,
and many others, some of which have been
indicated, Mrs. Gurney’s Letter requires at
least no “apology” for being made public.</p>

<hr class="r45">

<p class="right fs80">
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <em>January</em> —, 1860.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear E * * *</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Your name has been always on my lips
and in my heart, and you alone of all the
world have never questioned me. I come to
you again, E * * *, as I have so often—as I
did when we were children, when you folded
me trustfully in your arms—and say to you:
I am as I was then; and I hear you say: Tell
me nothing, for I believe you always, and
there must be no questioning between us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>What I shall write to you will not be to
cast a doubt upon our perfect and entire
sympathy by any explanation, but to fulfil
what I feel to be a duty towards you—to put
you in possession of all that may weigh in
the least degree with those at all understanding
my nature, before whom you care
to justify your steadfast attachment to me,
though the performance of this duty, dear
E * * *, may impose upon me the revelation
of my inmost life. If, in your judgment,
there will be here presented aught of such
justification, show it to them, wholly or partially,
just as you think well, remembering
that this is for your sake, not my own. My
justification it would be needful to make
before a much wider tribunal, for I have
perpetrated an act which the whole conventional
world have leagued together, in
ignorance, prejudice and hypocrisy, to denominate
a crime, and I could expect little
or no sympathy from that wide bar of public
judgment that knows nothing of me nor of
my surroundings, and which never could be
made to comprehend my nature; or, comprehending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
it, would not even then, at this day,
be prepared to accept any argument or explanation
in extenuation of my course.</p>

<p>E * * *, you remember me at fourteen;
you remember the time we returned from the
visit to Wymondham; you remember how,
repulsing the cold influences overcoming me
in spite of myself, I dashed down in the carriage
the plain bonnet they had asked me to
wear that day, and stamped on it, and let
all my hair fall down upon my shoulders,
and said: I am free. You remember it well.
And then, at last, when the carriage reached
the house, how we threw ourselves into each
other’s arms, and I had no more courage,
and feared to avow the act, telling them you
sat down on it—and you were still; and
then how I cried all night, that I denied the
truth of my nature—that I was not free.</p>

<p>E * * *, that day repeated itself through
my life—in every act, in the worship of God,
in my marriage, in the very conception of
my children; and I looked forward to its last
repetition only in my death.</p>

<p>It is past now—my living death is over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
I have chosen between the universal condemnation
of the world and my own sense
of right; not in any sublime way, but in the
simple, truthful way my nature craved. I
lie down in the evening and rise in the
morning, for the first time since a child,
blessing God for my existence. Nothing
can rob me of this now but death alone. I
have that treasure to a woman’s heart that
a woman can alone understand—the open
avowal of the love that controls her being.
With it, part of it, all of it, is the man, free
from prejudice, filled with every noble aspiration,
who is its object. Should I, I ask
you, have preferred the reputation which the
world accords to her who, yielding to its
forms, becomes daily the living lie it approves?</p>

<p>They who go on disposing of human instincts,
human affections and human brains
in their own way, according to their own
sense of right and wrong, should go further;
they should change their meeting-houses and
churches into monasteries and convents, and
watch the religious aspirations they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
control by daily and nightly supervision. Into
their homes they should introduce harem espionage,
that the bodily instincts, which
they hold in enforced compliance, may never
have an opportunity to assert the truth about
themselves.</p>

<p>Heresy and adultery, the two excommunicative
words, which social life suspends over
the doomed head of a woman who thinks
and acts contrary to its rules of action, have
not that full power and effect they are supposed
to have. Nothing but actual physical
imprisonment of the body, and, if it were
possible, of the mind, can prevent a woman
from becoming the secret avower of her belief
and of her instincts. The excommunicative
words do not restrain from either offence;
they only develop that unquestionable
vice of woman’s weakness, hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The brain, when infidel, is infidel by its
own proper organization, and they who assail
its infidelity strike vainly at the God
who made it, and implanted it in every newborn
soul; the body, when infidel to the connection
in which it is placed, is so by its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
own proper instincts, and they, who attempt
to control it, strike, likewise, at a law of its
creation.</p>

<p>When will narrow-minded, bigoted men
learn that the one absolute, controlling law
of a woman’s nature is love—that it is the
only good and desirable thing about a woman—the
only reliable thing about her?
They can trust her, with her love, to live in
a house of prostitution; they cannot control
her, without it, by the most absolute, social
ostracism.</p>

<p>And this love, what is it? It is a power
present always in the world, which, recognized
by two like natures, thenceforth binds
them to each other, beyond the control, and
in violation, if need be, of any other law—as
my mother’s love bound her to my father,
and my father’s love bound him to her, and
gave me my being—a being cradled in the
tenderest, truest passion that ever existed
between two human beings.</p>

<p>How long have I been in ascertaining and
yielding myself up to this divine law! What
wasted years! What subjections derogatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to the vilest nature! What hypocrisy, dishonoring
to God! What suffering have I
caused this man, assigned to me alone, since
that day on which I first in him recognized
myself!</p>

<p>It seems so long ago; it seems far longer
to me than the time makes it; it seems as if
an eternity had rolled backward to that day.</p>

<p>Oh, I had questionings of right and wrong
in that fathomless interval of despair, far
other, far deeper, than all I had been taught
or could be taught by their lips—questionings
that brought me to the very brink of
death.</p>

<p>Why should I have loved him? Why do
I love him? What is it I love in him? All
this I have asked myself a thousand times,
and there has never been, can never be, an
answer to all this questioning.</p>

<p>Yet I say now to you: Why should I not
love him? What is there not to love in him?
My heart only answers: What is there in me
that I should be loved, that I should know
that joy which in its tiniest moment makes
all years of other time a mockery?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>And these questions do we ask each other
daily and nightly forever.</p>

<p>And yet there is one reason, they say, why
I should not have loved him—one word there
is which the world places as an impassable
barrier between us—a word that has never
crossed my lips till now—a meaningless
word, and yet involving in their eyes a
crime as great as that adultery which I
commit—just as great, for both are equally
meaningless as touching our relation.</p>

<p>And that word expresses the social position
he bore me. Rather than have been
his lawful wife even, I might have been a
king’s mistress, or any nobleman’s paramour,
with less offence.</p>

<p>And I, who was the reputable bawd of
marriage rites, was I above him? I, a daily
offence against decency in obedience to the
same social law that would have forced him
to life-long humility? Was I above him?
How? In what way? I, sunk, in the abasement
of my own weak unnatural compliance,
below the veriest nameless outcast? Could
I be above anything? Was he not at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
my peer? He, who, if we leave too such
vapid questions of distinction, is Hyperion
to a Satyr compared in person with me—short,
fat, little body that I am!</p>

<p>I have silently asked myself in his arms,
when I dared not soil our lips with their
utterance, about these words—groom and
adulterer. Yet well I knew that they had
no relation to our love—that they were but
words—that a true soul no social contamination
defiles or degrades—that nobility unrecognized
and virtue an outcast, wherever
placed, are eternally the same.</p>

<p>I had learned these lessons from a parent’s
lips. The example of my own true-hearted
mother had taught me this. My own life
had been given me in violation of society’s
teachings.</p>

<p>Noble-hearted woman! who could say (I
their child, and the only one that blessed at
last their union, nearly a year old then:)
Richard Gurney, I have withholden from you
nothing; I have sacrificed all at the altar of
love—even my little Marian—yet I ask no
formal bond of union in return; I care not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
for it. What I had when our little one’s life
began—what I have now—what I know
nothing can deprive me of now—your love—contents
me. And he as nobly answered:
Not for the sake of it, Mary, for it will
have but little acknowledgment from my
kindred or the world; but for the pride of
the open avowal, and for the sake of our
little girl, I marry you.</p>

<p>And this love, so true, so self-immolating,
met, as he anticipated, with no approbation
from his family. You remember how my
husband, as an especial favor, asked Miss
——, and would solicit the members of his
family, to accompany me to see my mother—a
woman as far above them all in every
instinct of her soul as was my father—the
true representative of the Lords of Gournai
and Le Braii.</p>

<p>Yet such was the affectation of superiority
they always persevered in!</p>

<p>I know the world says we who are of English
lineage never look so low to find high
things.</p>

<p>This is not, and was never, true of me nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
of my blood. I would, were it needful to
find my ideal, as my father before me, search
through any situation, just as men dig
down for jewels; and I would have delved
to the uttermost profound for that which I
now possess. But he whom I loved was not
so far; he was near me by the permission
of that social law we have offended. The
home of his family became established near
my own. He was oft actually beside me,
and separated only by that word from me;
nay, he had right to touch me by permission
of this social law—was charged temporarily
with the safety of my life even—could speak
to me, but respectfully—respectfully! He
who was in reality of kindred blood, and
made for me—for me—whom they paid
court to, not because of the instinct of that
blood, but because of the narrow thrift of
my kinsmen.</p>

<p>But enough of this. I might have spared
myself the contempt that tingles through my
veins.</p>

<p>I loved him, E * * *; that was all. He
became all I did, all I said, my very life. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
I say more I may err, for I truly know no
more, and shall never know more than this.</p>

<p>The whole scope and measure of a woman’s
heart and brain, and the whole purpose
of her being, is love; and her whole
knowledge forces itself into one inquiry: Am
I worthy of the love of him I love? And
does he love me? But I have thought over
all this social matter, and have asked myself
if I could have loved him better if he had
not been what he was—if he had been a
member of Parliament? Well, they had been
plenty in our family—there were, among the
rest, uncle Hudson, and cousin Charles, and
cousin Edward Buxton, and cousin Priscilla’s
husband; so, too, father had consented to
be; and finally, Jackey himself was there, and
filling Walpole’s chair, or at least the edge
of it. And what was it but too palpable a
sham? We all knew this—men and women—and
we lived on it meanly, enjoying the
empty honor and the empty praises of those
in truth below us, because they so stupidly
praised us. Oh, it was so foolish, all this
member of Parliament pride! I loved William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
rather because he was not a member of
Parliament—at least because it was not his
aspiration. And then, if he had been an
elder of the meeting? He!—what think you
of that, E * * *? Or my Lord Bishop of
Norwich—the Lord of diluted <em>pater nosters</em>—was
he above him? Are these the things
to marry a breathing woman to? Does any
one think a <em>liaison</em> with the Bishop would
have ennobled me?—or the embraces of the
elder?</p>

<p>It is scarcely needful to say to you, my
dear, that in the above there is not the
slightest personal disrespect intended to Mr.
Pelham or any other individual being.</p>

<p>True men are not such. A woman’s instincts
repel such forms of men. You may
dress the real as meanly as an American
slave, or you may elaborate the attire of the
counterfeit to the antipodes of this—to pontifical
robes—and the living soul of a woman
will never fail to distinguish the false
from the true.</p>

<p>Why you yourself, E * * *, would have
wept your eyes out, I am sure, if I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
have deliberately linked myself to the lifeless
purpose in which the vitality of such
beings ends.</p>

<p>He is not one of these. He is a man,
E * * *, whom I love. Do you wonder I
love him? It is because he is a man—a
man, and not a hollow make-believe.</p>

<p>It is so with every true woman. In her
love she recognizes no distinction of position.
The gods of her idolatry, like the
statues of the Greeks—whether standing in
a rough warehouse or in the Louvre—remain
unchanged in the calmness of their
beauty and power. We ask nothing more
of them but themselves, to gaze upon them,
to become intoxicated, and to die with the
love of them. Such seems to me the man
to whom, by the profoundest law of my nature,
I yield my being.</p>

<p>But will the world understand this? Perhaps
it is the accident of my place and
estate, that, surrounding me with what passes
by the name of power, made me see its emptiness—that,
uniting me to the highest representative
of a religion in the person of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
son who put it lightly off, made its meaningless
character apparent—that, teaching
me to strengthen a family distinction by
the unconscious sacrifice of myself to him
in whose control I had been somehow left,
taught me to question if it were right, and
at last to rise above and throw off the chains
of an unnatural compliance.</p>

<p>My intercourse and secret correspondence
with you from my early girlhood taught you
how wayward, how passionate I was; and
those letters are so much a part of me that
I cannot write anything again as they were
written.</p>

<p>You have preserved them; read them
again, even to the days that followed my
unnatural blood-kin union and its results.</p>

<p>Blood-kin union it was. Intermarriage
always.</p>

<p>There was the marriage of my husband’s
uncle John with my aunt Elizabeth, first
cousins.</p>

<p>Blood-kin union of my husband’s father
and mother, third cousins.</p>

<p>Intermarriage of my husband’s uncle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Henry Birkbeck, with Jane Gurney, third
cousins.</p>

<p>Intermarriage of my husband’s father with
Mary Fowler, cousin of his first wife.</p>

<p>Is it strange that such unions should
prove unfortunate? Elizabeth Gurney and
Jane Birkbeck only survived their marriages
a year. Jane Gurney, my husband’s mother,
lived but four or five years of marriage life.</p>

<p>There, too, in the case of grandfather and
aunt Agatha, was the anomaly of father and
daughter marrying sister and brother.</p>

<p>There was the marriage of my husband’s
cousin Henry with Jane Birkbeck, his second
cousin.</p>

<p>Then came the marriage of Catharine Gurney
with her first cousin, Edward Buxton.</p>

<p>Then Rachel with Thomas Buxton, another
pair of first cousins.</p>

<p>About a year thence, after the interesting
grief on his part at the death of his aunt
Fry, our uncle Buxton, and his old Balls,
John Henry brought about his marriage with
me, both of us the great grandchildren of the
same pair—I, a thoughtless girl then staying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
at Earlham, and he nearly twice my age.
But I don’t blame them. Heaven knows
their ignorance of my nature, and the utter
want of congeniality in everything between
his and me.</p>

<p>You know the ideal my heart and passions
craved, and you know this reality circumstances
and family considerations brought
me; and you know from the day of that
marriage I was silent. For when body and
soul were in this, at last, both gone, I resolved
to bear all patiently and submissively—to
act and be the lie to the last. Indeed,
as years wore on, it became almost my
nature. I lost my inner light, as they say.
I became a woman to look down from my
social position and dwell in the proprieties
forever.</p>

<p>There was then but one hope for me, and
that hope was based upon the fact that I
could not write to you. The pure, simple
instincts of my girlhood, the ungratified passions,
the real intelligence, lingered in me
still. I dared not write to you—to you, who
knew me so well, I dared not confess what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
my life had become. Yet more—I still had
faith in my nature, because I felt I was
silently degrading the crowning act of my
mother’s life by my weak and unnatural submission.
I had faith over all when I first
shrunk from the compliance with my vow,
and when I prayed its living fruit might be
in her image and not in mine. I felt then
the force of nature  *  *  *  *
*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *</p>

<p>Thus year after year passed away, and
thus should I have lived and died; but I
saw him, I heard his voice, I learned daily
his thoughts, I revelled in his nature! Then
I wrote to you again; my faith had become
a living power; I began a new life.</p>

<p>Then came the fall, as ever before. The
influence of social restraint was too terrible,
and I sunk back as I did that day when
we were children. This last assertion and
denial of my nature brought me to the verge
of death, but it brought me to reason also;
and then, an altered being, weak and broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
down, I rose, and with one fearful, silent
struggle, that our sex’s nature alone can
know, I was forever free! Oh, the revelation
of that hour! Life seemed in a moment no
longer hard and difficult. Its relations were
simple, its passions legitimate, its love supreme.</p>

<p>But let me narrate to you how I awakened
to the reality of my position, my after experience,
and how at last I had the strength
to accomplish my emancipation.</p>

<p>The first few months of my married life I
was truly not happy; but I cannot speak of
that period as one of unhappiness. Indeed,
during the whole spring I did not fully realize
what that covenant means that disposes
finally of the life of a woman, and that, too,
at a time before the meaning of her nature
consciously asserts itself. The novelty of
the change, the new interests arising, the
necessity to be a wife—all these feelings
and emotions shut out myself from myself.
And so it went on, month after month, in
which I cannot recall anything that awakened
me fully to the reality of my position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>But, E * * *, it was ordered in my life that
it should come, and it came. A simple incident
defined to me the meaning of my vow.</p>

<p>Among our visits to Earlham was one we
made on the first day of the following autumn.
I remember the date and the appearance
of the country well. I shall never forget
either. The fields were undulating with
their golden grain. Costessy Park was in
its fullest verdure. Everything seemed rejoicing
in the coming harvest—the happy
maternity of earth. And so we reached
Earlham.</p>

<p>The first object I saw was Anna’s child.
It impressed me profoundly. I took him in
my arms, and as I looked at him everything
grew dark about me. I had been before the
toy of a ceremony; I was now a conscious
wife. Beautiful lawn and woodland, summer
breezes, kindness, marriage rites even, what
can they avail against the first awakening
consciousness of a crime against nature?</p>

<p>I was wholly without sympathy; there
were none around me to understand me. If
I had spoken my thought the very air would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
have been filled with condemnation. I, a
wife, had I a right to entertain for an instant
such an idea? Could I dare to experience
an instinct of aversion? Had I a right to
say I had been violated—that I was what all
women loathe?</p>

<p>I could not understand it; yet there it remained,
a fact of my nature, asserting itself
against the condition in which I was placed,
and from which apparently no earthly power
existed to release me.</p>

<p>I returned to Easton an altered being;
but this feeling wore off somewhat in the
routine, and in the necessities of married life—for
his father’s death, occurring shortly
after, you remember, involved many changes
and responsibilities, which turned, in a measure,
for a time, the current of my thoughts.</p>

<p>Afterwards succeeded, at constantly recurring
intervals of a year or two, many
other deaths in our families which tended to
check my free indulgence of thought, till at
last my feelings settled simply into a sense
of a vague but awful responsibility of a violation
of the social law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>You must recall the constant distress and
trouble into which we were all plunged by
the successive deaths of his sister Anna, his
aunt Catharine, my father and the children.
The family at I—— Hall, too, was a weight
which never ceased to press upon my heart,
and, indeed, upon my whole existence.</p>

<p>And so I lived, but not among the living.
I had my inner life and my outward life—what,
I doubt not, other women have had as
well as this poor one at Catton. I drummed,
in the old school-girl way, into my husband’s
ears the set tunes for the piano, utterly unobservant
of the music. I dressed in the
same mechanical way to receive his relations,
and thanked God when they were
gone—and so underwent, beneath a conjugal
yoke of continued kindness, a slow
death. I entered into the life around me
as an actress, real herself only when away
from the stage of her action. I became the
same that other women become, who turn
from human faces to brute things for comfort.
My early passion for horses and dogs
proved then my consolation. I had to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
full that mental nervousness which craves
allayment in action. It would be impossible
to admire a horse more than I had always
done. It was an instinct of my nature,
just as of Landseer’s, or of old Mary Breeze’s,
of glorious memory; but I loved them now,
for they were so much to me!</p>

<p>But when alone, immured, away from
every one, I lived my fullest life. My imagination
went away boldly, admiringly, lovingly,
to other men. They were not objects
of jealousy, dear E * * *, for they were
dead.</p>

<p>I lived with the memories of the founders
of our family—men who never sat upon the
clerk’s stool, and could never have claimed
the benefit of clergy—men with strong arms
and stalwart frames, making their deeds of
knightly prowess known in a hundred battles—with
the memories of Hugh, and Walter,
and Anselm, and Girard, and Reginald, and
Matthew and John, who in the Holy Land
fought at Prince Edward’s side, and rendered
their red cross a terror to the Paynim. And
my memory, only too tenacious, as you know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
kept each noble form before me, with all the
vividness of a present reality.</p>

<p>I lived with them, too, in their pastimes, in
which—side by side with the Black Prince,
in the eyes of their sovereign, and their gracious
mistress, his Queen Phillippa, at the
tournaments, held on the very spots where
I daily rode—they mimicked their glorious
achievements upon the veritable fields of
blood which they had won.</p>

<p>I admired their splendid force, their brains
not emasculate with such education as I saw
around me, nor hampered with narrow trade
tricks. I wondered what work they would
be about if they were living to-day. I tried
to imagine how any of the family could have
got down, step by step, generation after
generation, to studying Greek verbs, or calculating
per cents.</p>

<p>Hugo alive, I knew well, would not be a
praying banker, but abroad in the free air,
adventuring crusades, simply and naturally,
in whatever way the time demanded, just as
the man I love, simply and naturally, and
yet so irresistibly, rescued the sepulchre of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
my buried hopes and desires, against the
law and the power, the ignorance and the
infidelity to human nature, of all around me.
All things great are simple. In the crusades
my ancestors adventured, they went a long
way across the world. It was as far as the
distance between groom and lady, but not
further. They conquered what was their own
by right of their nature and their belief,
and with such a struggle as every one must
undergo who undertakes the assertion of his
right against social law.</p>

<p>They conquered theirs as he did also his
own; and does not his seem an act like, or
nobler, than theirs? Is the rescue of a dead
body a worthier act than the rescue of a
living soul?</p>

<p>It was not so hard a conquest. My requirements
were simple and natural. I was
surrounded by everything unreal and artificial.
I demanded the society of a living
man, free from the education and influences
of a family holding all these foolish theories
that deprive us of the real enjoyments of life—one
who could look upon water as water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and drink it without a homily—look upon
food, not as a subject of prayer, but of mastication—enjoy
the sunshine and air as sunshine
and air, and talk with men and women
as such without shrinking from them as heterodox,
or loving them as orthodox too well—one
who could listen to music and find it
pleasant to the ear, and not be exercised
whether God intended it should be agreeable—who
could contemplate a picture not as
an engine of the devil, but a work of art—one
who could enjoy all delights as requirements
of nature, and not as subjects of a
deep concern. In Mr. Taylor I found such a
man. He looked upon all these things as,
indeed, I also saw them; but with him it
was not a matter which cost him questioning.
He knew it all without thought, and
without education, as they call it. He lived
in the intuitive knowledge of it.</p>

<p>In the interchange of kindred thoughts
about these things we lived day by day,
until, unconsciously, I found myself craving
every word he spoke. I found his presence,
which took me back to the men of my ancestral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
pride, a necessity of my life, and, at
last, I felt myself for the first time beneath
an influence of love.</p>

<p>The night that followed this discovery,
when I knelt down by my bedside, his image
stood between me and the far-off height on
which my subjected brain had placed God.</p>

<p>And when I saw him there, I struggled, as
I had been led to believe was duty, to dash
down the image that stood at once in the
way of my human vows and in the very presence
of the stern methodical God of their
education.</p>

<p>Yet there it stood, and there it must stand
forever. Yes, dear E * * *, I loved him almost
before I knew it; and he I felt, moreover,
loved me, though not a word was
spoken between us. It was not his to
speak, and I would have concealed from my
very inmost self the fact of this love.</p>

<p>But it could not be so forever. To maintain
the form of a superiority, where none
existed, became at last an impossibility.
We loved, and the expression of it I foresaw
could no longer be controlled by either,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
and so it came first from my lips. He was
riding beside me, and did not reply to me.
He said, out into the air, into the heavens:
God has given me too great a joy. Then he
turned to me and said: I have loved you
from the first day I saw you. I loved you
because I felt it was my destiny; other than
this I know not why; I only know I loved
you.</p>

<p>Dear E * * *, he was so beautiful, so noble
then, in the expression of that love so long
concealed. The earth whirled around me,
and his arm caught me falling unconsciously.
When I came to myself I was resting on his
bosom, confident of its strength as of a
breastplate of iron, though I saw his eyes
dim with tears.</p>

<p>We rode homewards in silence. There
was a beauty in the very stones beneath our
feet. The wayside flowers had an odor too
exquisite to the sense. The air and sky
were filled with an influence too beautiful
for earth. I was very, very happy. Could
this feeling have rested in me, I had been
content—faithful to my duty, as I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
taught—to have lived ever so. But my
heart was now craving constantly the repetition
of that moment. It could not be satisfied
but in his presence. Hitherto patient
only under a sense of wrong, I now began to
be agitated by a passion in which every
feeling of my life had centred.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to recount all the conflicts
which it brought to me, nor to trace
the way in which my nobler nature sunk
gradually before the threatened penalty of
social destruction; it is enough to say that I
was borne by it to the decision which involved
my destiny, and I yielded to the social
law for the last time, because I had not yet
come to that point at which a woman, driven
to the very presence of death by the pressure
of a false relation, thinks at last for
herself, and hesitates no longer how to shape
her course, should even the remaining wreck
of her life be dashed to destruction.</p>

<p>Last autumn I began to feel myself breaking
down. I could live thus no longer.
When the time came we usually went to
London, a while before the opening of Parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
I felt that the crisis had come. If I
went down with my husband in any hope of
escaping the feelings that were mastering
me, I knew well that on my return this life
of passion would only recommence at sight
of its object. If I remained alone, I believed
I had strength to put it from me—I believed
I could part with him, if for the days or
weeks that would follow, after I had left him,
I might meet no other gaze than God’s—if I
might exhaust the despair that I well knew
would follow in silence.</p>

<p>I remained, therefore, at home.</p>

<p>I was not deceived in myself. The artificial
being they had created of me was
strong enough to assert itself and to sacrifice
the love that lay in my heart’s depths—but
not till the last moment. It was only
upon the very brink of my husband’s return,
that, arousing myself from the brief dream of
happiness into which, secure in his absence,
I had weakly fallen, I could summon the
energy to take the draught of agony which,
I believed, the hand of duty had prepared
for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>But further delay was now impossible.</p>

<p>I had him come to me. My heart was
like a cup overrunning; my grief knew no
expression. He was before me, at my feet.
I cannot describe—no one dares acknowledge
what passes between lovers, sundered
by a social law; it is not possible to express
that life within life, the innermost, the last.</p>

<p>I have brought you to me, I said, because
I can see you no longer—I am dying.</p>

<p>My God, it seemed to me then as if my
heart would break—as if I should go mad!</p>

<p>A moan of agony came to his lips.</p>

<p>He looked up at me; the intelligence of
his face was gone; his eyes were dim; the
despair that was in me changed his face
to stone.</p>

<p>I looked on him immovably; I could say
to him: We must part forever. I could
repeat again the phrases of social life:
There can be no honorable recognition of
our love—its open avowal will bring disgrace
to my husband and odium upon my
children.</p>

<p>And how did he reply to me? Shall I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
confess, even there, in that hour of my
strength, my utter weakness! I longed for
a pleading word. One look of tenderness,
and I should have fallen at his feet a ruined
being, but ruined in the acknowledgment
and utter abandon of my love.</p>

<p>Well he knew all this; but in that crisis
he was true to himself, and to me; and when
he ceased speaking, I was again strong. My
head, my heart, every instinct of my being,
approved his words, his looks, his actions.</p>

<p>He had saved me. He, as I knew him in
that hour, was my strength; through him I
conquered myself. I was strong in that
final trial, as a woman only can be strong—through
the soul and heart of the man who
stands steadfast to himself and to her to the
bitter end.</p>

<p>He said: Even in this hour, when every
hope and joy of life have sunk away into
eternal despair beneath your words, I can
be true to my sense of right; I believe life
requires no sacrifice; I believe self-sacrifice
wrongs not only her who, blindly, in its belief
as right, accepts it, but those the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
for whom it is accepted. If, with your sense
of duty, you were to sever the relation which
binds you to them, it could bring you no
happiness; its severance, as you feel, would
bring at last misery to both, for your happiness
is mine. There is no rule, no duty in
life, but the pursuit of happiness. Mine
can alone be purchased now at the cost of
your own, and that is mine. We must part,
then, forever!</p>

<p>The utter despair of these words can
never leave my heart.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There were many things he said in this
last interview which I recall, but it matters
not now should be repeated. Our lives
express them more clearly than words. He
spoke of the false relation which he had
gradually been led to assume, and into the
continuance of which our passion had held
him day by day.</p>

<p>I knew well, he said, it should long ago
have been terminated; but I knew not then,
as now, the controlling power that has kept
me by you until this hour. I believed, first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
that I might love you, and that you might
remain forever unconscious of my love.
And so I lived till this was impossible.
And then my life became one eternal delay
of hope, enduring all to this last measure of
despair. It could not be otherwise. I
believed from day to day that you would see
clearly, as I saw, the right, and so it might
at last end. It is over now! My life is
over. My lot is hopeless, endless misery.
I accept it for your sake—for the memory of
our love.</p>

<p>Then my life, my very soul, met his in one
long kiss of agony, and we parted, as I
believed, forever.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I had conquered my life; this social law
had achieved its triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When my husband reached home I was
strong to do the last duty which my position
imposed upon me. I knew well that, cost
what it would, this must also be done. I
must live the life, to which I was bound,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
openly. I went to him and told him of my
love, of my resolution, and of our separation.
Much passed between us at this horrible
time; but all that was in my heart to say
was just these words: I love William. Of
the rest, and of what followed, I have no
clear remembrance.</p>

<p>I only knew now that he must be gone—that
life, hope, all were gone, though I
remained there still that honorable thing, a
wife! For me, it was determined that I
should leave England for a time. I was to
travel. A change of scene they prescribed
for the invalid of the heart. It was always
the same, the same ignorance of a woman’s
nature and its necessities. They would have
me enjoy Paris, Rome. They would substitute
the splendor of the Vatican for some
little flower that might perchance come from
his hand should I remain at home. It
seemed so much more to them.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the contemplation of the
ruins of my life, I took no heed of these
arrangements for my departure, but abandoned
myself a willing prey to despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>When the full measure of my grief had
exhausted itself, I arose a new being.</p>

<p>From that moment I was myself. I had
driven every hope, every feeling from my
heart. I had received from his lips the last
sacrifice a man can offer to the woman he
loves—the abnegation of himself for her
happiness; and I declare before Heaven
that it was my resolve to do what I thought
right, though it cost me my life; for I had
nothing now to live for.</p>

<p>I had long followed blindly a passion that
brought me to the verge of social destruction.
I had renounced it.</p>

<p>I had blindly followed for years a path
of duty which had degraded every instinct
of my nature to its last measure of degradation.</p>

<p>I could feel no more—I reasoned.</p>

<p>The meaning of the life I was about to
enter upon was now distinctly before me.
What it appeared to me, I well knew it was,
in very reality, for I was now freed from
my love. I had sacrificed all for duty. I
could see now to what the blind obedience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of that duty had led me. What I was I now
knew.</p>

<p>My soul was clear from hypocrisy—there
was not any lie upon it now. I had confessed
all. My very life was laid open to my
heart’s core. My love was gone, as well by
his will as my own, forever.</p>

<p>What had I accomplished? I had preserved
the chaste name of wife. I had preserved
the honor of my husband and the
reputation of his children. And to do it, I
was beneath his roof, and was about to
submit myself to his embraces without love.</p>

<p>For these considerations of honor and
reputation, I was about to lead voluntarily
a life of prostitution, distinguished from it
only by the social fiction of a name, and I
felt myself more degraded for all this honorable
hire than she who accepts her paltry
dole in the streets.</p>

<p>I was, moreover, about to fulfil functions
from which every fibre of my body shrunk
with abhorrence. I was there to give life to
offspring created in my own degradation, in
violation of my will and nature, the effete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
offspring of blood kin, children to die feebly
before their time, or perhaps to come into
the world, they, or their children, deformed,
or dumb, or blind, or imbecile. I, who was
perfect myself, and formed to receive and
transmit the sacred treasure of a new life,
was to become voluntarily the matricide of
the more perfect conceptions which should
be mine.</p>

<p>Better, in the agony of that thought, I
said, better death than this—better self-immolation
of body and soul; it were far
less a crime.</p>

<p>And then, shuddering with horror upon
the brink to which duty had led me, I supplicated
my soul imploringly for light, as I
asked myself the great question: Does any
law of God sanction, shall any law of man
have the power to continue, the bond of
marriage where no love exists?</p>

<p>And I answered it, as my children, if they
inherit aught of my nature, shall at last
approve, as the world shall at last come to
understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Thus was I at once and forever severed
from all former relations and left alone in
the world.</p>

<p>I write these last words quietly, here at
my writing desk; but that inquisition of my
brain, it was terrible—more terrible even
than the death I had accepted in parting
from him.</p>

<p>But my decision was made, and I was
calm then.</p>

<p>I knew in that moment the rest of a fearful
struggle of the brain—the poor weak
brain of a woman—that swept the world,
though, beneath her feet.</p>

<p>There was grief in that family, when I
became in that decision myself, and stood a
stranger among them; when the social fabric,
his children, their father, false pride, conventional
position—all had overthrow; when
my mother’s wrongs had revenge, and my
father’s love had justification, in the child of
his life-wronged wife!</p>

<p>But their grief was joy to the agony of
calm in which I made that decision.</p>

<p>Not a tear came to my eye when I told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
it them; not a pulse stirred in my breast.
How inconceivable to them all this agony.</p>

<p>My husband was even still solicitous to
preserve the form of a union, now no longer
possible in reality. One of those formality
doctors of the soul was sent for—his uncle
Francis. O! after all the agony I had
passed through, I might have been spared
the sight of one of those whose words had
sanctioned and stamped upon me, as if by
the authority of God, all this misery.</p>

<p>But how weak and idle to me were his
words about theological sin and social infamy.
They fell on my ear, in constant repetition,
meaningless as the dropping of the
beads of a rosary.</p>

<p>He told me I was imperiling my soul, and
he left me with some formal expression of
pious horror, when I told him I would willingly
incur that risk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now I was alone in the world—my
life still before me—severed from every living
relation—to be lived or ended. What new
connections must I assume? Unsupported,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
helpless, alone, where should I go? What
must I do?</p>

<p>In those past ages the convent doors would
have been open to me; but my intelligence,
the intelligence of the very age in which I
lived, forbade me the immolation of my living
body and my free soul.</p>

<p>And then came to me again the idea of
suicide.</p>

<p>I did not shrink from this thought superstitiously,
as fearing to rush unbidden into
the presence of the offended deities. I had
no such thought. It meant to me only rest
from this great burden and weariness of life—to
lie down and sleep while it was yet
day—to sleep forever.</p>

<p>But I was too calm for the rashness of
this act—too strong. If they, who retired
to the cloister from a sense of a superstitious
duty, willingly endured its burden, I,
with larger intelligence, could not sink beneath
their lower thought, and weakly die.
No, I had committed no crime that I should
die; nor were my past misfortunes a reason
why I should voluntarily impose new ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
upon my life to come. I knew I was in the
world to live. Vigor of body, of mind, passions,
desires, reason, all that goes to make
up a human soul, were in the full tide of
existence; and I was here surely not to contemplate
death, but to fulfil the functions of
life—of a new life.</p>

<p>For I had absolutely died in that decision
to live free from my bond. I was dead to all
past relations and connections. I was dead
to the social world around me, as if I had
never lived before. The consciousness of my
identity was gone. Every eye rested strangely
